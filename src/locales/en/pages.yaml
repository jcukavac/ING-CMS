    problem-title: The Problem Beyond Pulse Faced
    problem-text-part1: As an early-stage startup with no internal tech team, Beyond Pulse had a need for a development partner that could meet a challenging list of requirements - proven track record in idea-to-production product development, breadth and versatility in terms of skills, scalability in terms of team size, and agility in the face of highly dynamic startup world.

    problem-title: The Problem We Identified
    problem-text-part1: We continue to see a large number of couples with children that separate or divorce in the first few years of marriage. This is especially true for the western world, where fewer parents of children are getting married. The crude marriage ratio for parents has fallen by almost 50% in both the EU and the US since 2000.
    problem-text-part2: The divorce rate, on the other hand, continues at approximately 50% for all marriages. And we’re on a mission to resolve this.
    solution-text-part1: We’re building Familipay with and for families.
    solution-text-part2: We’ve already visualized some features such as parental calendar and reimbursement payment methods as these are the most common problems and topics shared by the parents. Our core team of software engineers and UX designers will be working closely with parents to develop and launch Familipay by the end of 2019 in the UK. And we are looking for additional investors to help post-launch efforts - primarily marketing distribution and mentorship to guide the US market penetration.
